            Is there anywhere that could truly be called paradise ?

            <p>
            Perhaps not, but, when the sun rises after an all night coding session, or the night job
            we had to take to service the mortgage when wages were cut, or even if it's
            the only job we could get, we should still take a second to look outside, at that golden sun rising over the turqouise
            water, and remember, that whatever trouble befalls us, we still can have something to
            speak the meaning to life.

            We're starting to get our geek community to come together. The google group is
                <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-bermuda">here</a>.
            There have been various attempts in, for instance, the dotNet and Arduino circles,
            and there is a robotics club as well as <a href="http://bermuda.io/">Bermuda.io</a>
            which leans toward opening public data for analysis from a general position that all such
            data should be open (highly admirable)
            </p>
            <p>
            Open Bermuda attempts to form a general community of technological enthusiasts, where
            sustaining such a community causes a perpetual cycle of circulating ideas and knowledge
            transfer between people interested in such fields as Mathematics, Programming, Biology,
            Oceanography, Public Policy, Climate Science, Electrical Engineering, Robotics ... Ok,
            there's just too much to list, but you get the picture
            </p>
            <p>
            If everyone works to keep the community at or above critical mass, then it should all work
            as planned and we'll make not only Bermuda a better place, but the World, too

            <h2 class="post-title">About Me</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
            My name is Damion Wilson and I've been a programming enthusiast for a while now
            (anyone else remember the Apple II ? Atari 800 ? Vic-20 ? I guess not).
            </p>
            <p>
            I've been lucky to have been employed programming in the banking, telecoms, trading,
            and reinsurance industries and even did some sysadmin/devops work too. Even so, I can't
            help writing code all the time (someone should eventually stop me)
            </p>
            <p>
            Right now, I'm in reinsurance working on risk systems with a group of really smart
            characters, and have a wonderful wife and two daughters, which is about the best
            anyone can hope for.
            </p>
            <p>
            I won't bother to tell all the things I've written stuff in, but what I like to write
            in these days are Python(Pandas, Numpy, Django), C++(Boost), C(yes, still), Erlang, and
            SQL(PostgreSQL, SQL Server). I have a weakness for Network and Systems programming
            which can be evidenced by the rather ancient
            <a href="http://cipe-win32.sourceforge.net/">CIPE-Win32</a>
            but I also have been known to do GUI work in perl with
            evidenced by the similarly ancient
            <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~dkwilson/Tk-DKW-0.03/">Tk-DKW</a>
            </p>
            <p>
            My more recent stuff will (eventually) appear <a href="https://github.com/damionw">here</a>
            </p>
            <p>
            Other interests are cycling, <a href="http://www.sanshou.bm/">martial arts</a>, cabinet carpentry and gardening
